# 1st_Github_repo
first in a long time...

I am finally getting back into coding, and for good this time. I have been slacking a bunch lately and procrastinating, saying, "Ehhh, I'll get to it tomorrow." That's not how life works. I need to start making progress towards my goals of one day being financially indepentent and becoming a successful software programmer. Too much time I have wasted not to have anything to show for, in the programming sense. This stops now!

Goals: commit to Github 3 or more times every day, besides weekends. 

Long-term goals: Have my life in order by the age of 25.
