# 1st_Github_repo
first in a long time...

I am finally getting back into coding, and for good this time. I have been slacking a bunch lately and procrastinating, saying, "Ehhh, I'll get to it tomorrow." That's not how life works. I need to start making progress towards my goals of one day being financially indepentent and becoming a successful software programmer. Too much time I have wasted not to have anything to show for, in the programming sense. This stops now! This is a fresh start for me as of today, and I must say, it does feel good to feel motivated and driven to bettering myself and to get back in the hang of things again. Albeit, I have to basically relearn coding because I have forgotten most that I have learned, but once you start learning something and have spent a decent amount of time in that particular thing, no amount of time can take that initial knowledge away from you. What has been learned, and learned well, can never be taken away from you.

Current goals: commit to Github 3 or more times every day, besides weekends. Talk to more people and be more social. Get a job.

Long-term goals: Have my life in order by the age of 25.
